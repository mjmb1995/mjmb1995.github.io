My name is Mark, and I am a Front End Engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have been working as an engineer for almost a year and a half as of writing this post. I originally decided to take this Software Engineering program to learn more about the back end and possibily get a Full Stack Engineering position after the program. Another reason why I am in this program is to help assist my younger sister who is also enrolled in this program. I believe this will help open new opportunities for her. 

I am looking forward to learning new things with this program. I know this will help me touch up on my existing skills and  develop new ones. I am also very interested to learn more about the "remote teaching" side of this  online program. After the program, I'd like to explore opportunities to help other people learn and reach their goals.
